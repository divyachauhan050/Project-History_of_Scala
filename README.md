# Project - Github History of Scala Programming Language

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the Scala language to map it's development over the years.
With almost 30,000 commits and a history spanning over ten years, Scala is a mature language, and I had to analyze who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts.

## About the Datasets
About the datasets:
I have used three different datasets (courtesy of Datacamp).

1. **‘pull_files.csv’** contains the files that were modified by each pull request.

2. **‘pulls_2011-2013.csv’** contains the basic information about the pull requests, and spans from the end of 2011 up to (but not including) 2014.

3. **‘pulls_2014-2018.csv’** contains identical information, and spans from 2014 up to 2018.
