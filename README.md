# Project - History of Scala Programming Language

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories.It involved data cleaning, correcting data types, exploring app categories, and obtaining a distribution of app ratings. These steps then helped in drawing insights about the app size and app prize, and this relationship was analyzed using jointplots.

## About the Datasets
About the datasets:
I have used two different datasets (courtesy of Datacamp).

1. **‘apps.csv’** contains all the details of the apps on Google Play. These are the features that describe an app.

2. **‘user_reviews.csv’** contains 100 reviews for each app, most helpful first. The text in each review has been pre-processed, passed through a sentiment analyzer engine and tagged with its sentiment score.
